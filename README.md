# Chart SDL Engine
This package will provide an API to render trading charts and give some graphics tools to do technical analysis using the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer).

## Actual State : Iteration 1 (see [historic for past iterations](https://github.com/Morgiver/chart-sdl-engine/blob/main/iterations.md))

#### Objectives for this iterations :
1. ~~Manage entities position in efficient manner. Will create a World manager or grid manager~~.
2. Research and development about the Quad Tree pattern to enhance the performance in managing position and managing collisions.
3. Re-think all Systems classes and split them into many little Systems.
4. ~~Build a Scene Manager and Scene class to handle different layers of drawing and/or different cameras or view angle.~~

# TODO List :
1. ~~Re-organise all class in multiple files~~
2. ~~Build the Grid Manager to manage all entities positions~~
3. ~~Build the SceneManager and Scene classes to be able to attach and manage entities in scenes~~

More todo incoming...
