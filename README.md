# Trading Chart SDL

This package will provide an API to render trading charts and give some graphics tools to do technical analysis using the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer).
It will provide access to tools created to collect data for training artificial intelligence as well.

## Actual State : Iteration 1 (see [historic for past iterations](https://github.com/Morgiver/trading-chart-sdl/blob/main/iterations.md))

#### Objectives for this iterations :
1. ~~Manage entities position in efficient manner. Will create a World manager or grid manager~~.
2. Research and development about the Quad Tree pattern to enhance the performance in managing position and managing collisions.
3. Re-think all Systems classes and split them into many little Systems.
4. ~~Build a Scene Manager and Scene class to handle different layers of drawing and/or different cameras or view angle.~~

# TODO List :
1. ~~Re-organise all class in multiple files~~
2. ~~Build the Grid Manager to manage all entities positions~~
3. ~~Build the SceneManager and Scene classes to be able to attach and manage entities in scenes~~

More todo incoming...
